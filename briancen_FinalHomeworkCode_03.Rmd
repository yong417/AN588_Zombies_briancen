## Question 1: Population Mean and Standard Deviation
```{r}
#Load the csv directly from Github
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/refs/heads/master/AN588_Spring25/zombies.csv")

#calculate the population mean and sd

# define a function to calculate population sd
pop_sd <- function(x) {
  m <- mean(x)
  sqrt(sum((x - m)^2) / length(x))
}

# create a list of variables that need to be calculated
random_var <- c("height", "weight", "age", "zombies_killed", "years_of_education")

# use for loop to calculate mean and sd for each random_var, df[[r]] is extracting the whole column as numeric vector so each value in the column will be called

for (r in random_var) {
  miu <- mean(df[[r]])
  sd <- pop_sd(df[[r]])
   cat("For", r, ",", "Population Mean =", miu, "and Population SD =", sd, "\n")
}


```
## Question 2:  Boxplots by Gender
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# reshape the data frame to make long format
df_long <- pivot_longer(df, 
                        cols = c("height", "weight", "age", "zombies_killed", "years_of_education"),
                        names_to = "variable",
                        values_to = "value")

# plotting each quantitative variable by gender

ggplot(df_long, aes(x = gender, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "pink", color = "skyblue") +
  # facet look at the unique variables and create a "facet" aka subplot for them
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of Quantitative Variables by Gender",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Value")

```

## Question 3:  Scatterplots of Height and Weight in Relation to Age
```{r}
# create scatter plot for height in relation to age
ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = height)) +
  geom_point(color = "hotpink", size = 1.5) +                    
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "purple", size = 1) + 
  labs(title = "Height vs. Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Height") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color = "purple", face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "hotpink", size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "purple", size = 12),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "pink", linetype = "dotted"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )

# create scatter plot for weight in relation to age 
ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple", size = 1.5) +                       
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "hotpink", size = 1) + 
  labs(title = "Weight vs. Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Weight") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color = "hotpink", face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.title = element_text(color = "purple", size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "hotpink", size = 12),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "purple", linetype = "dotted"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )

```
Response: height and weight seems to increase with age, showing a positive correlation. However, most data points are around the age of 20 and within the age range there is a lot of fluctuation of both weight and height.

## Question 4: Distribution check and qq plot
```{r}

for (r in random_var) {
 # loop over the quantitative variable to create histogram
  print(
    ggplot(df, aes(x = df[[r]])) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
      labs(title = paste("Histogram of", r),
           x = r, y = "Frequency") +
      theme_minimal()
  )
  
  ## loop over the quantitative variable to create qq plot
  print(
    ggplot(df, aes_string(sample = df[[r]])) +
      stat_qq(color = "blue") +
      stat_qq_line(color = "red") +
      labs(title = paste("Q-Q Plot of", r),
           x = "Theoretical Quantiles", y = "Sample Quantiles") +
      theme_minimal()
  )
}


```
Response: Height, weight and age seems to have normal distribution. Zombie kills and years of education are right skewed and they consist of discrete counting number. Thus, it suggest that the samples are from possion distribution.

## Question 5: Sampling 30 Survivors and Estimating Confidence Intervals
```{r}
set.seed(888)          
df_sample <- df[sample(nrow(df), 30, replace = FALSE), ]


vars <- c("height", "weight", "age")

for (v in vars) {
  # Extract the data for this variable
  x <- df_sample[[v]]
  
  # 1) Sample mean
  xbar <- mean(x)
  
  # 2) Sample standard deviation
  s <- sd(x)
  
  # Sample size
  n <- length(x)
  
  # 3) Standard error
  se <- s / sqrt(n)
  
  # 4) 95% confidence interval using the t-distribution
  alpha <- 0.05
  df_t <- n - 1
  # Critical t-value for a two-sided 95% CI
  t_val <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df_t)
  ci_lower <- xbar - t_val * se
  ci_upper <- xbar + t_val * se
  
  cat("Variable:", v, "\n")
  cat("  Mean:", xbar, "\n")
  cat("  Sample SD:", s, "\n")
  cat("  SE:", se, "\n")
  cat("  95% CI:", "[", ci_lower, ",", ci_upper, "]\n\n")
}

## for non normal distributed variables

  boot_means <- replicate(boot_n, {
    boot_sample <- sample(x, length(x), replace = TRUE)
    mean(boot_sample)
  })
  return(boot_means)
}

#--------------------------------

boot_means_zombies <- bootstrap_mean(x_zombies, boot_n)

# Bootstrap estimates
boot_mean_zombies <- mean(boot_means_zombies)
boot_se_zombies <- sd(boot_means_zombies)
ci_zombies <- quantile(boot_means_zombies, c(0.025, 0.975))

cat("Zombies Killed:\n")

## Question 6: Sampling Distribution of Means
```{r}
library(tidyr)

vars <- c("height", "weight", "age", "zombies_killed", "years_of_education")

# Number of samples to draw
n_samples <- 100

# make a data frame with five columns each corresponding to the quantitative variables and 100 rows each for one of the sample mean and name the column with the variable names
sample_means <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = length(vars), nrow = n_samples))
colnames(sample_means) <- vars

set.seed(360)  # for reproducibility

# Draw 100 samples of 30 survivors and calculate means
for (i in 1:n_samples) {
  sample_i <- df[sample(nrow(df), 30, replace = FALSE), ]
  for (v in vars) {
    sample_means[i, v] <- mean(sample_i[[v]])
  }
}

# Calculate the overall mean and standard deviation (SD) of the sampling distribution for each variable
sampling_result <- sapply(sample_means, function(x) c(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)))
print(sampling_result)

# Plot the sampling distributions using histograms:
sample_means_long <- pivot_longer(sample_means, cols = all_of(vars),
                                  names_to = "variable", values_to = "sample_mean")

ggplot(sample_means_long, aes(x = sample_mean)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "pink", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Sampling Distributions of Means (n = 30)",
       x = "Sample Mean",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()





```
response: The means, SD and SE from [5] is not far from that from [6]. However, since [5] from only one observation, it can not represent the true popultion mean, SD and SE as well as the sampling distribution. The smapling distributions for all variables are about normal distributed which is exactly what the central limit theorem tells us. Regradless of the original sample distribution, as long as the sample size is large enough, the distribution of the sample mean tends to be normal.
