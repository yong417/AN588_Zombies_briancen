I will list some of my struggles when doing the hw below

# 1. Uploading a GIF:
Embedding a GIF was challenging because I had to ensure the image URL was correctly formatted and accessible from the final output document.
# 2. Using the rmdformats::readthedown Theme:
Working with the rmdformats::readthedown theme required me to understand its specific configuration options, such as setting toc_depth appropriately.
# 3. Creating and Using a Custom Population SD Function:
Developing a custom function to calculate the population standard deviation was a bit tricky because it required correctly implementing the formula and ensuring the function worked for all numeric vectors.
# 4. Looping Over Variables for Multiple Plots and Computations:
Iterating over a list of variable names to generate histograms, QQ plots, and compute summary statistics posed challenges with dynamic data extraction and consistent formatting. Debugging the loop structure and making sure that each variable was properly referenced across different plotting functions helped me improve my R programming skills.
# 5. Creating the string for variables:
It also took me sometimes when making the string of variables
